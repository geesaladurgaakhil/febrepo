1.Abstraction:-
->Abstraction is nothing but hiding the details of implementation method and expose only interface.
->This is because of avoiding the unnecessary complications to users.
->The main aim of user is to call the abstract method and use that method.This can be achived by object creation.
->This object creation is done in helper class with an helper method..
->The helper class contains a helper method with a return type of interface.
->then this method creates an upcasted object and returns the referance variable to the interface by return statement.
->finally user has to take the refrance variable and call the method..


-------------->:ABSTRACTION SUMMARY:<-----------
**Hiding implementation details of a method and providing access only to method signature is called abstraction.
**Abstraction can be achieved in two ways
	1.By using interface
	2.By using abstract class
**The main goal of abstraction is"User need not know where method is implemented and how method is implemented.
**The purpose of abstraction is to avoid unnecessary confusion and complexity for user.
